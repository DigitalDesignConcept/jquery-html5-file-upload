== Description ==

This plugin adds a file upload functionality to the front-end screen. It allows multiple file upload asynchronously along with upload status bar. It also lists the uploaded files as a gallery and allows us to delete the uploaded files. This is well suited for users who want to submit files to the admin, but can be altered in any required form. It make use of the HTML5 capability of the browser and fallback gracefully for browsers not supporting HTML5. 

The main advantage of this plugin is that it does not use flash and that it doesn't need any third party plugin. The uploaded files are stored under the 'upload' folder under the sub folder 'files' where the files are segregated based on the logged in user into different folders.
